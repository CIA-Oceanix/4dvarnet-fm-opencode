# Changelog

## 2026-06-30: Initialize opencode project guidelines

**Summary:** Added AGENTS.md, opencode.json, and initial CHANGELOG.md to establish a consistent workflow for opencode sessions.
**Files modified:**
- `AGENTS.md` — new: project guidelines with session workflow, commands, conventions
- `opencode.json` — new: project opencode config referencing PLAN.md and CHANGELOG.md
- `.gitignore` — removed `opencode.json` exclusion so the config can be committed
- `CHANGELOG.md` — new: implementation log
**Rationale:** Ensure every opencode session follows a consistent workflow: read PLAN.md, implement, verify, log changes.

## 2026-06-30: Add experiment plan for τ=0 CFM ablation

**Summary:** Created `docs/experiment_G_tau0_cfm.md` documenting a proposed experiment to test whether VanillaCFM's advantage over DirectUNet comes from multi-τ training or from the residual loss formulation.
**Files modified:**
- `docs/experiment_G_tau0_cfm.md` — new: experiment plan with motivation, code changes, configs, and expected outcomes
**Rationale:** Plan to isolate the effect of random τ sampling by training VanillaCFM with τ=0 only and comparing RMSE against full CFM (F1-F3) and DirectUNet (E2).
